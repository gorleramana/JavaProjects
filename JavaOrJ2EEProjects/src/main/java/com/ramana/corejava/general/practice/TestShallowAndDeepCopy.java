 *         There is no hard and fast rule defined for selecting between shallow
 *         copy and deep copy but normally we should keep in mind that if an
 *         object has only primitive fields, then obviously we should go for
 *         shallow copy, but if the object has references to other objects, then
 *         based on the requirement, shallow copy or deep copy should be done.
 *         If the references are not updated then there is no point to initiate
 *         a deep copy
 * 
 *         Lazy Copy:--
 *         A lazy copy can be defined as a combination of both shallow
 *         copy and deep copy. The mechanism follows a simple approach â€“ at the
 *         initial state, shallow copy approach is used. A counter is also used
 *         to keep a track on how many objects share the data. When the program
 *         wants to modify the original object, it checks whether the object is
 *         shared or not. If the object is shared, then the deep copy mechanism
 *         is initiated.
