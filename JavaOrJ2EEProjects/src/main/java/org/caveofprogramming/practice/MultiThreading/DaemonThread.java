 *         Daemon thread is a low priority thread that runs in background to

 * 
 *         Daemon vs User Threads
 * 
 *         Priority: When the only remaining threads in a process are daemon
 *         threads, the interpreter exits. This makes sense because when only
 *         daemon threads remain, there is no other thread for which a daemon
 *         thread can provide a service. Usage: Daemon thread is to provide
 *         services to user thread for background supporting task.
